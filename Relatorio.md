# PokedexAPI
This is the "Relatorio" of the project. This project was firstly thought to be something like a playlist but then we noticed it wasn't very good so we "recycled" the idea to make a kind of Pokedex.

## First steps
At the beggining, to start with the project was very hard for us because we have studied anything about web development html, css or this stuff so we were strugglig to much, but when we started to understand Swagger and OpenAPI it got a bit easier for us

## Development and ideas
We had to many ideas to implement to the project (everything related to Pokemon) like to show if the pokemons were catched, or some kind of map functions (the regions), but we didn't have to much time to do everything so we've done the essentials

## Understanding everything
It was hard for us to understand everything about javascript because we've never used code to make a web page. We couldn't understand how the files were created by coding in the yaml file so we had to make a lot of investigation on the internet.
To create the database was a headache because it was complicated to understand the relations beetwen tables and how to do the foreign keys and the primary keys but finally we did it and it works

## Dockerhub
I think dockerhub was our worst enemy on this project because we got stuck for 2 weeks with an error we couldn't solve. Even our teacher was struggling to find it. Nevertheless, we think dockerhub is a very interesting platform to try and test all these projects. It is not very hard to understand how it works and to create the dockerfiles isn't to difficult but we haven't seen dockerhub before so it was a bit difficult for us to understand how to do the files and what are the functions of each file

## Conclusions
To make this project took so long for us because it started very difficult. We were so lost when we started doing everything and we thought it would be impossible to end the project but then asking to the teacher and searching for information on the internet allowed us to improve the project to develop it in the right way. It was very difficult at the beggining but once we developed it, it got a bit easier
